# CLICpix2 Testing Scripts for peary

This repository contains test configurations and (very urlgy, quickly drafted) ROOT scripts to test the CLICpix2 readout chip using the peary software (https://gitlab.cern.ch/Caribou/peary)

The analysis code should (at some point) be cast into some more sensible data analysis framework.
